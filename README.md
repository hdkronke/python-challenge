# Python Challenge
## Module 3
For this project, I used two datasets to practice Python coding.

The first dataset featured banking data over several years. My program generates a summary of profit changes!

The second dataset holds hundreds of thousand of votes in an election. The program I wrote filters the votes by candidate and announces the winner!
